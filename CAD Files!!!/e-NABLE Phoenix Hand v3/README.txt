e-NABLE Phoenix Hand v3 by e-NABLE on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4056253

Summary:
This is a remix of the excellent e-NABLE Phoenix Hand, developed by Jason Bryant, John Diamond, Scott Darrow, Andreas Bastian, Team Unlimbited, e-NABLE France, and Jeremy Simon.When using this design for e-NABLE hand assembly workshops, we found that people had difficulty telling the different pins apart. There are six different sizes of pins used in various places throughout the hand, and it can be difficult to distinguish some of them visually. This modified version includes labels on the ends of the pins to help identify them.Please refer to these printable assembly instructions for details about the pin labels (see letters to the left of each pin in the upper left diagram on page 1). The document is provided in both a left-hand and right-hand version. This way, you can print it out on double-sided large format paper and use it as a reference during assembly. The diagram on the first page/side can be used to layout the parts, and the step-by-step instructions on the second page/side can be used as a reference during assembly.Left Hand: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1caYKGoE5w9RL3n52ls-7htutYQ34OLoD/view?usp=sharingRight Hand: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1caT-qSH-01H-uLoA75pY2E4LHxce84tP/view?usp=sharingAlso, check out the assembly tutorial video here: https://youtu.be/CXoVSTgzyecFully editable source CAD files are available here: https://a360.co/35DrgeuAssembly materials kits are available here: https://shop3duniverse.com/collections/3d-printable-kits/products/phoenix-hand-by-e-nable-assembly-materials-kitNote that the parts need to be scaled according to the measurements of the person it's being made for. At 100% (normal scale), the device would only fit a very small child. In most cases, parts need to be scaled up.
